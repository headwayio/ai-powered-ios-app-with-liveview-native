# Building an AI-Powered iOS App with LiveView Native

This Livebook notebook is an example of an AI-powered iOS app built with LiveView Native. It demonstrates how to use the LiveView Native framework to build a simple iOS app that uses Elixir's ML ecosystem to classify text.

To interact with this iOS application, you will need to install [LVN Go](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/lvn-go/id6614695506) on your device.

This notebook was used as the basis for a presentation given during Startup Wisconsin Week 2024.
